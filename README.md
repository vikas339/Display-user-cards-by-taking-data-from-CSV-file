# Display-user-cards-by-taking-data-from-CSV-file

Create a frontend that takes the CSV as input using a FileField.

The CSV is parsed and all the user data is stored inside an array of JSON / local storage.

Display all the user cards (from the CSV) and show it to the audience.

Allow the audience (who uploads CSV) to delete and user by clicking.
